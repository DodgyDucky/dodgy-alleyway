                    I'm gonna try something else today. Yesterday I wrote the entire blog post in one sitting and I wanna try just jumping to and 
                    from writing stuff today. I can't realy get my head on straight today. Everything feels realy foggy and messy and I just feel realy 
                    iritated for some reason.<br><br>
                    I had trouble sleeping again. I went to bed at 9pm and couldn't fall asleep until around 11pm, and then woke up at 2am. I've been feeling 
                    realy iritable and agitated recently and it's been realy annoying. I started smoking ciggarets again wich I haven't done for about 4 months now. 
                    I fucking hate smoking. I hate the taste, the smell cling to everything and it makes me feel like I wanna throw up. But I do it anyways because it 
                    makes everything bad in my head go bye bye. It makes me feel present. I'm aware that it's slowly killing me but it makes me feel alive for a moment. 
                    I don't think I'm a big nicotine addict, I've got like 6 cigs left and I bought the box last november and I don't realy feel like I couldn't stop myself 
                    from buying another one, but when I do start smoking regulary thats's a signal to me that something is seriously off. Usualy when I had smoking episodes 
                    it would be because something hurt inside. Suicidal thoughts, self distructive episodes, breakups that sort of thing. But now I seriously dont know what the 
                    fuck is wrong. I feel numb and lost. I feel like that scene from Trainspotting where Mark sais: <i>Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone.</i>
                    I need to find something to do and some new people to hang out with but I keep walking into the same type of people.<br><br>
                    Nothing changes if nothing changes.<br><br>
                    Fuck man it's realy hard to even work on anything. Projects, house chores, everything. Usualy I try to keep my place clean, almost obsessively clean, but right now it's a mess. 
                    I think if I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight I'm just gonna force myself to clen up my place. I feel dead at work anyways from lack of sleep so might as well do something productive with it. 
                    It's hard to even cook anything man. I've been surving off pasta and just mixing it with pre made sauces. Maybe I'll go shoping once in a while but nothing seems to peak my interest.
                    These god damn extreme highs and extreme lows are starting to take a toll on me. I feel like I want out, but I've been living like this for so long that I know that if I'll just wait 
                    it'll go away on it's own. Fuck it at this point I'm just rambling.<br><br>
                    I'm attracted to self destruction. I see that what I'm doing is bad for me and the people around me but I can't stop myself. I'm not even sure if I want to stop myself. 
                    I'm not sure if this is a phase that's just been taking realy long to get over, but I'm sick of it. Duality of man type shit. I feel like I'm at war with myself. And no one can help me.
                    Or I'm just overreacting to a bad hair day or something. But when I think that I feel like I'm just ignoring the problem. I've come to the realization that no one gives a fuck about anyone but themselves. 
                    And that is both freeing and terifying at the same time. Also it's not completely true. You can care about someone else for your own selfish reasons. I think I'm gonna try writing a blog 
                    post once word for word how it sound in my head. Multiple people arguing and debating.<br><br>
                    At the end of the day I'm a person with an artistic spirit, that doesn't mean that I'm good at art or anything just that I'm a person who strugles to expess themselves even to myself. 
                    And that's why I create to try and express. And like with any process I fail again and again. Over and over. But never stop.<br><br>
                    Creation is destruction and destruction is creation. And I'm not sure if what I'm doing right now is creative destruction or destructive creation.

                <p>
                    First actual blog post on here. The fuck do people usualy blog about. IDK never realy read any blogs. 
                    I guess I'm just gonna write about the shit that's on my mind here, doubt anyone's gonna read this shit anyway.<br><br>
                    So yeah, I'm writing this at work (the whole website) because there's nothing to do here. I've been here for 5 weeks and out of that
                    there was maybe like one week that anyone wanted anything from me. It's a slow job but I'm not complaining, more time to work 
                    on my personal projects and shit. The first week they literaly had no one to teach me how to do the job, so they told me to go play 
                    some games or something. Than the week after that the guy who was supposed to show me around showed up, but we mainly just dicked around 
                    and chatted, so no work again. Thats when I started working on this page again. Sort of wanted to make a port folio of the stuff I work on. 
                    The next 2 weeks were a plant shutdown. No one was here exept me and Ctibor (the instructor/mentor guy) and some other leftovers. 
                    We had 2 weeks to go through inventory and clear out anything that was not supposed to be there, we had it done the first week. 
                    Ctibor felt kinda sick so he said fuck it and took the next week of, I couldn't take time off yet so i went to work the whole week. 
                    So I pretty much go to work officialy as na expediant, but they pay me to write this web site &#9787;. <br><br>
                    Other than that I've been trying to get my shit together. I thing I've always been kinda whacked in the head, but after the breakup with Lucie I felt kinda 
                    like something in me was lost. I started going to a psychiatrist, thats been helping I guess. Everyone always ask like "Oh is it helping?, 
                    Are you feeling better?". Like yeah but no. I feel like I have to pay someone to listen to me insted of feeling comfortable just speaking to 
                    someone. The fuck do you thing I feel like. I feel better sure, getting this shit out of me instead of bottling it up is great, but I just feel 
                    that I would rather share shit with someone close. But than severe trust issues came in and said "Nah nigga u ain't doing that."
                    I've been trying to get over that, and I feel that I've made significant progress but it's always there. It never truly leaves. <br><br>
                    Also if anyone does read this and sees a buch of spelling mistakes, I couldn't be bothered to fix them, I'm running of like 3 
                    hours of sleep. I couldn't fall asleep last night and woke up at 3am for some reason. <br><br>
                    What else ... I still feel like I want to write something more but I'm not sure what. This that direct stream of conciousness type shit, gonna start writing the ehs... and uhs... 
                    I keep saying in my head.<br><br>
                    IDK like the two biggest thing on my mind right now is that I want to work on some projects, which is courently taken 
                    up by working on this website and trying to date again. The problem with that is that I feel like I push people away, and when I do I feel lonely. 
                    The eternal cycle of iritation and lonelyness. The worst thing is I dont thing I can be fixed, managed sure but not fixed. I courently live in a 
                    shithole of a town where most of the people are aged 40+, and fuck all activities for younger people. So IRL socializing is realy rare. Instead I've 
                    been trying dating apps, and that just feels realy disconected. It lacks a sortof humanity too it. You don't see the non verbals, you cant hear tone of 
                    voice. You are kinda forced to judge people by their cover. Half the people don't even bother to write a proper bio. The hastage interest systems are dog shit, 
                    with most people having basic shit like "I like music", like yeah nigga, who doesn't? But It's not all bad I like the weirdos, for some reason they make 
                    me feel at home. But again I feel like it never goes anyware. You try to meet up with some one and most of the time when I ask they are like yeah sure, 
                    but then keep making up excuses and pushing it back. I don't mean to sound paranoid but after like the 8th time I'm realy starting to question what the 
                    fuck is happening. Like is something wrong with me or is this how people try to say I'm not interested in a way where they try not to hurt your feelings? 
                    Honestly a simple fuck off would get the message across more clearly. I try to tell myself that they realy don't have time and would like to go out and reschedule, 
                    but getting stuck in this loop every time of "Oh sorry next time" and "Oh ok" is starting to wear me down. As I said I want to believe and I try to, 
                    just there's a limit and I'm starting to feel like an idiot for trusting people. There's a couple of girls that I've been trying to plan dates with 
                    and I realy hope that that doesn't happen again. <br><br>
                    But hey, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Am I right?
