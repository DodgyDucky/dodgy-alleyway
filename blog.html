                    So I decided to start this blog over. The last time it felt like just a bunch 
                    of angsty ramblings. This time I want to put at least a bit more effort into 
                    what actually goes here. <br><br>
                    This thing is publicly accessible so I don’t want to use this as a private diary 
                    anymore. I still don’t think anyone reads this, but some shit should stay private. 
                    Even though I want to get it off my chest somehow. <br><br>
                    I want to try turning this into a kind of study of my artistic process and all this 
                    related to that. My thoughts about projects that I’m working on, ideas, inspirations 
                    and all that. <br><br>
                    For example, recently I started seeing this tattoo artist by the name of Ladybug 
                    and I think I kinda got hooked on getting tattoos. It hasn’t even been two months 
                    yet and I’ve already got six tattoos. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to get 
                    more because I liked getting tattooed or because I found her attractive. And even 
                    after asking her out and getting rejected I still want to get more. And to be honest 
                    I’m still not sure if it’s just the tattooing itself or the whole shabang. One way 
                    or another my mood has been up since I started that. I’m starting to get back into 
                    working on stuff. Small stuff so far but better than nothing. Finally got to work on 
                    nDies (Mathaels new name) profile pic and banner. Planning a little Halloween stream 
                    on the Anarchy channel just to kind of keep it alive a bit. And I’ve really been feeling 
                    like getting back into music, maybe even making and album or an EP.
