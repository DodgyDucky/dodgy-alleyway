                    So I’m sick as shit, didn’t work on anything yesterday and now have a full schedule 
                    of shit I have to do. YIPPEEEEEEEE!!! Thank fuck that this weekend is longer by Monday. <br><br>
                    Hopefully I’ll be healthy by than so I can work on something. I’d like to get this 
                    website to a presentable state. So I need to figure out the lightbox stuff and then 
                    figure out how to promote it. <br><br>
                    I also need to clean my place up, I don’t even remember when the last time I properly 
                    cleaned it was. I quickly went over everything about 2 weeks ago, but the last big shake up 
                    was some time before the flood.

                    So I’ve been sick for the last couple of days. Sore throat, sniffly, tired, 
                    all the standard bullshit. I was supposed to go get another tattoo yesterday and 
                    I’m kinda glad that it fell through, it wouldn’t be as much fun hopped up on all 
                    that ibuprofen. <br><br>
                    I really need to start working on something. Like an actual creative project, paint, draw, music or 
                    something. Working on this site is fun but it’s not something I can space out to. The rings are fun 
                    to make, but I only make those on demand. Yesterday while I was cleaning I put my easel in the living 
                    room, so hopefully I’ll start working on something. Might be fun to work on something while I’m sick 
                    and come up with some crazy delirious shit. <br><br>
                    Otherwise I still have no idea what direction I’m taking or even want to take in life but I guess 
                    shit’s been good lately. Maybe going a little crazy with the tattoos but eh, gotta do something fun.

                    I've been thinking of adding a store to this website. I’ve been making these wooden 
                    rings that glow in the dark and I’d like to try selling them to make an extra buck 
                    for tattoos and stuff. <br><br>
                    But then again there’s literally no traffic on this site, so I don’t expect it to go 
                    anywhere. I’ve never really done any advertising for anything I do, but I’m gonna try 
                    throwing it up on Instagram and seeing how that goes. <br><br>
                    Other than that I got three more tattoos this weekend. I’m pretty sure I’m addicted &#9786;. 
                    Ever since I started getting tattoos I’ve been feeling a lot better, but I’m still having 
                    a hard time expressing it. Every time I’m there I feel like I should smile more and talk 
                    more, but I just kinda freeze up. Not in an anxious way really, more like lightheaded from 
                    the tattooing. The anxiety is still a factor just not as much as it used to be.

                    So I decided to start this blog over. The last time it felt like just a bunch 
                    of angsty ramblings. This time I want to put at least a bit more effort into 
                    what actually goes here. <br><br>
                    This thing is publicly accessible so I don’t want to use this as a private diary 
                    anymore. I still don’t think anyone reads this, but some shit should stay private. 
                    Even though I want to get it off my chest somehow. <br><br>
                    I want to try turning this into a kind of study of my artistic process and all this 
                    related to that. My thoughts about projects that I’m working on, ideas, inspirations 
                    and all that. <br><br>
                    For example, recently I started seeing this tattoo artist by the name of Ladybug 
                    and I think I kinda got hooked on getting tattoos. It hasn’t even been two months 
                    yet and I’ve already got six tattoos. At first I wasn’t sure if I wanted to get 
                    more because I liked getting tattooed or because I found her attractive. And even 
                    after asking her out and getting rejected I still want to get more. And to be honest 
                    I’m still not sure if it’s just the tattooing itself or the whole shabang. One way 
                    or another my mood has been up since I started that. I’m starting to get back into 
                    working on stuff. Small stuff so far but better than nothing. Finally got to work on 
                    nDies (Mathaels new name) profile pic and banner. Planning a little Halloween stream 
                    on the Anarchy channel just to kind of keep it alive a bit. And I’ve really been feeling 
                    like getting back into music, maybe even making and album or an EP.
