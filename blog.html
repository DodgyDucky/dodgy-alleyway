                    I want to do something realy stupid. Like something I know is bad for me. I feel like I've run out of options. Every time I try to do something good it ends up badly so maybe if I do something bad it'll turn out 
                    great. That might be what's driving my self-destructive tendencies lataly. That fucking quote from fight club keeps popping into my head <i>"Self improvement is masturbation."</i> , the only way forward is 
                    self-destriction. I kinda feel bad for being so negative and pessimistic all the time but I got here trying to do good and failing repeatedly. I feel lost and desperate to get out of this spiral. I also sometime 
                    think about the saying <i>"The road to hell is pathed with good intentions."</i> wich is supposed to mean that when you promise somethink and don't do it, it's worth jack shit. But recently it feel like it means 
                    that if you try to do good you'll only end up hurting others.<br><br>
                    I don't know what I sould do or what I'm gonna do. I think that if some one ever read the shit I write here they would think I'm about to shoot up a school or something. But I don't feel like that. I want to hurt 
                    myself and only my self. I've done shit like this before when I got into drugs a couple years ago. I'm sick of my own bitching and moaning, but one thing I can't deny is that I do hurt inside. And it's only getting worse.
                    And the drugs don't do anything anymore nothing realy does. I'm stuck in this harsh reality. Maybe I did this to myself through the drug use. If I had to guess it would at least have some sort of impact on how I feel. 
                    But I've always felt like this. Even as a kid I didn't have a lot of friends my mom worked and studied at the same time, so I mostly had to entertain myself. 
                    That would be probably when my abuse of stymulating actions and substances started. Whether stealing shit from the medicine cabinet or binging video games and tv shows.
                    I've always just ran away from pain. Life is pain and right now I feel like I want to run head first into it. Maybe it's some sort of way to try and catch up in life or some 
                    sort of fear of missing out. I just feel like I haven't done shit with my life and I want to change that.<br><br>
                    What's the point of lying on your death bed and dying without any regrets.<br><br>
                    My dad is supposed to visit me tommorow. And I have no idea of what I should say or do. I haven't seen the man in over 20 year, and the only thing going around my head is that I want to scream at him. I keep telling myself 
                    that I can't do this shit sober. I still don't know if im going to roll up a joint or take a pack of cigs with me. I'd love to scream at both of my parents what the fuck we're they thinking when they had me. If I was just some 
                    half assed attempt at keeping theyr marrige together. But I'd actulay feel bad if I did that to my mom, so might as well just take it out on him. No one has ever clearly told me what happened between them. I've heard so many 
                    versions of the story that I don't even know what's real anymore.<br><br>
                    I used to be happy at some point, but the older I get the more of that it'll get better mentality seems to just float away. The world just seems shitier and shitier day by day. 
                    I don't get how some people do this shit until they're 80 years old. I feel like in the past people had each other, that there was some sort of trust to one and other. But nowadays you're taught that 
                    everyone's out to get you. That they just want something from you, to use you. I think it was always like that and people were better at ignoring it. Nowadays with the news and social media it's such a constant 
                    barrage of information, an onslaught of negetivity that's hard to escape. In todays world, even though it seem like you have a infinite amount of options, i feel like there are actualy only 3. 
                    Option 1: Conform with an outside group. Usualy people who go out drinking and partying. These people like to be loud, like to be seen and will agressivly anounce theyre presence to everyone around. 
                    Option 2: Conform with a group on the wired. Internet peole hiding behind screens. These people seem to throw morality out the window sooner or later. Chasing the next high of whatever they drug of choise is.
                    Option 3: Disconect from the world. Become a hermit. All 3 of these options are neither good or bad, everyone has their own aproach and ways of dealing with situations that result form chosing one of these. 
                    I've also massively simplified these groups. What im trying to say is that there arent as many roads to go down in life as people like to claim.<br><br>
                    I think I'm just mad at the world, beause I don't see a point in living when I have no one to share this life with.

                    <b>Fuck it we back bitches!</b> I don't know what the fuck happened again. I just felt super pissed off yesterday when I got home, like nothing was fun. 
                    And just said fuck it I don't give a shit, I'm not gonna sleep anyways and just started cleaning my whole place. Disinfecting shit and stuff. And then I stopped 
                    feeling angry for some reason. Like yesterday I felt better but right now I feel fucking invivible.<br><br>
                    It's kinda strange writing this and having nothing to complain about. Sleep is still fucked up tho, but it's always been like that. I need to get some weed, that 
                    shit makes me sleep like a baby. I think I'm gonna take a day off from working on the website today, my brain hurts from trying to learn javascript and I just don't want to 
                    burn out. <br><br>
                    To be honest if I'm not feeling like shit I start to get bored. My head is pretty much empty. That would be fine at home I'd just smoke a joint or something and watch stargate all day, 
                    but I'm at work now and I'm just sitting here staring at the screen and thinking of what I could think about. Actualy right now my colleague is fucking pissing me off. It's like 
                    noone ever told him to keep his mouth shut when he eats. Thats kinda why I dont like eating with people. Chewy mouth noises piss me off. I don't know why czech people have to always also eat 
                    like the most smelly fragrant shit known to man. Like today I'm having a good day so I'm not gonna flip out or anything, but I do kinda wanna bring this up. I fucking hate czech culture. 
                    I don't know what it is with these people but, they will offer you some thing and they will keep asking you if you want this or that like a million time. I said no the first time. Now fuck off. 
                    If I'll want something I'll ask. They don't seem to get that some people have bigger social boundries. They'll come up to you like 5cm away from your face and when you backoff they'll come closer.
                    I get that I'm the outlier here, but like nigga please, I tried to respectfully get you out of my hair do you want me to tell you I want you to fuck off.
                    The worst part is that whenever I bring this up, everyones always like <i>"No, czech people are supper nice and hospitable."</i> Sure I'm not dissagreeing with that. But I don't like it and I don't trust it.
                    To me it feels like they're trying to get under my skin. The same with racism. Czech people are racist, not in a bad way but they are. Most czech people are white, so they never had to deal with racism. 
                    But as a black person, you kinda can't avoid it. I would call czech racism passive racism. I don't think they mean any harm, the problem with it is when you hear that shit over and over and over again.
                    I feel like czech people see me as nothing more than whatever theyre stereotype of a black person is. I don't blame them either, I guess most of them just see black peole in media and don't have a real like 
                    example to go off. Like my dad realy likes czech people, but he doesn't have to live here and deal with them on a daily basis. Of course not everyone is like that, but a lot of the time it just comes off like that. 
                    Even like when people like you they'll say shit that just makes me feel like and outsider. I've been aproached by women before giving me compliments like <i>"Oh you look realu exotic."</i> 
                    I get that they mean well but it makes me feel like I'm one of the others. Like I'm a fucking tourist stuck in someone elses country. Technicly I am czech, I've lived here my entire life, never even realy traveled, 
                    but I've never felt like a part of the group. For a very long time I've had this feeling that I'm not supposed to be here. That where are all my people feeling. I feel different and I am different and I don't feel like 
                    anyone here could ever truly understand. There are people who get close, but it's never realy it.<br><br>
                    I'm not saying that I'm not a stereotype. I just feel that I became a stereotype to fit in and be accepted and now I hate my self for it but find it hard to change.<br><br>
                    But fuck that bullshit today is a good day. I'm probably gonna get home get stoned and finish cleaning the rest of my place up. Also no cigs yesterday, so thats good. 
                    Honestly in the process of writing this I went from <b>fuck it we so back</b> to <b>I dont realy care that much about anything</b>, not completely shity just neutral. 
                    I also keep trying to figure out how to deal with this feeling of lonelyness thats in me. It feel like a growing void that I'll never be able to fill up. 
                    And I feel like that's my fault. A sort of punishment for being myself. I keep trying to date and socialize and just catch up with my social skills but it just doesn't feel like me.<br><br>
                    Maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Maybe I'm not supposed to fit in.

                    I'm gonna try something else today. Yesterday I wrote the entire blog post in one sitting and I wanna try just jumping to and 
                    from writing stuff today. I can't realy get my head on straight today. Everything feels realy foggy and messy and I just feel realy 
                    iritated for some reason.<br><br>
                    I had trouble sleeping again. I went to bed at 9pm and couldn't fall asleep until around 11pm, and then woke up at 2am. I've been feeling 
                    realy iritable and agitated recently and it's been realy annoying. I started smoking ciggarets again wich I haven't done for about 4 months now. 
                    I fucking hate smoking. I hate the taste, the smell cling to everything and it makes me feel like I wanna throw up. But I do it anyways because it 
                    makes everything bad in my head go bye bye. It makes me feel present. I'm aware that it's slowly killing me but it makes me feel alive for a moment. 
                    I don't think I'm a big nicotine addict, I've got like 6 cigs left and I bought the box last november and I don't realy feel like I couldn't stop myself 
                    from buying another one, but when I do start smoking regulary thats's a signal to me that something is seriously off. Usualy when I had smoking episodes 
                    it would be because something hurt inside. Suicidal thoughts, self distructive episodes, breakups that sort of thing. But now I seriously dont know what the 
                    fuck is wrong. I feel numb and lost. I feel like that scene from Trainspotting where Mark sais: <i>Here I was surrounded by my family and my so-called mates and I've never felt so alone.</i>
                    I need to find something to do and some new people to hang out with but I keep walking into the same type of people.<br><br>
                    Nothing changes if nothing changes.<br><br>
                    Fuck man it's realy hard to even work on anything. Projects, house chores, everything. Usualy I try to keep my place clean, almost obsessively clean, but right now it's a mess. 
                    I think if I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight I'm just gonna force myself to clen up my place. I feel dead at work anyways from lack of sleep so might as well do something productive with it. 
                    It's hard to even cook anything man. I've been surving off pasta and just mixing it with pre made sauces. Maybe I'll go shoping once in a while but nothing seems to peak my interest.
                    These god damn extreme highs and extreme lows are starting to take a toll on me. I feel like I want out, but I've been living like this for so long that I know that if I'll just wait 
                    it'll go away on it's own. Fuck it at this point I'm just rambling.<br><br>
                    I'm attracted to self destruction. I see that what I'm doing is bad for me and the people around me but I can't stop myself. I'm not even sure if I want to stop myself. 
                    I'm not sure if this is a phase that's just been taking realy long to get over, but I'm sick of it. Duality of man type shit. I feel like I'm at war with myself. And no one can help me.
                    Or I'm just overreacting to a bad hair day or something. But when I think that I feel like I'm just ignoring the problem. I've come to the realization that no one gives a fuck about anyone but themselves. 
                    And that is both freeing and terifying at the same time. Also it's not completely true. You can care about someone else for your own selfish reasons. I think I'm gonna try writing a blog 
                    post once word for word how it sound in my head. Multiple people arguing and debating.<br><br>
                    At the end of the day I'm a person with an artistic spirit, that doesn't mean that I'm good at art or anything just that I'm a person who strugles to expess themselves even to myself. 
                    And that's why I create to try and express. And like with any process I fail again and again. Over and over. But never stop.<br><br>
                    Creation is destruction and destruction is creation. And I'm not sure if what I'm doing right now is creative destruction or destructive creation.

                <p>
                    First actual blog post on here. The fuck do people usualy blog about. IDK never realy read any blogs. 
                    I guess I'm just gonna write about the shit that's on my mind here, doubt anyone's gonna read this shit anyway.<br><br>
                    So yeah, I'm writing this at work (the whole website) because there's nothing to do here. I've been here for 5 weeks and out of that
                    there was maybe like one week that anyone wanted anything from me. It's a slow job but I'm not complaining, more time to work 
                    on my personal projects and shit. The first week they literaly had no one to teach me how to do the job, so they told me to go play 
                    some games or something. Than the week after that the guy who was supposed to show me around showed up, but we mainly just dicked around 
                    and chatted, so no work again. Thats when I started working on this page again. Sort of wanted to make a port folio of the stuff I work on. 
                    The next 2 weeks were a plant shutdown. No one was here exept me and Ctibor (the instructor/mentor guy) and some other leftovers. 
                    We had 2 weeks to go through inventory and clear out anything that was not supposed to be there, we had it done the first week. 
                    Ctibor felt kinda sick so he said fuck it and took the next week of, I couldn't take time off yet so i went to work the whole week. 
                    So I pretty much go to work officialy as na expediant, but they pay me to write this web site &#9787;. <br><br>
                    Other than that I've been trying to get my shit together. I thing I've always been kinda whacked in the head, but after the breakup with Lucie I felt kinda 
                    like something in me was lost. I started going to a psychiatrist, thats been helping I guess. Everyone always ask like "Oh is it helping?, 
                    Are you feeling better?". Like yeah but no. I feel like I have to pay someone to listen to me insted of feeling comfortable just speaking to 
                    someone. The fuck do you thing I feel like. I feel better sure, getting this shit out of me instead of bottling it up is great, but I just feel 
                    that I would rather share shit with someone close. But than severe trust issues came in and said "Nah nigga u ain't doing that."
                    I've been trying to get over that, and I feel that I've made significant progress but it's always there. It never truly leaves. <br><br>
                    Also if anyone does read this and sees a buch of spelling mistakes, I couldn't be bothered to fix them, I'm running of like 3 
                    hours of sleep. I couldn't fall asleep last night and woke up at 3am for some reason. <br><br>
                    What else ... I still feel like I want to write something more but I'm not sure what. This that direct stream of conciousness type shit, gonna start writing the ehs... and uhs... 
                    I keep saying in my head.<br><br>
                    IDK like the two biggest thing on my mind right now is that I want to work on some projects, which is courently taken 
                    up by working on this website and trying to date again. The problem with that is that I feel like I push people away, and when I do I feel lonely. 
                    The eternal cycle of iritation and lonelyness. The worst thing is I dont thing I can be fixed, managed sure but not fixed. I courently live in a 
                    shithole of a town where most of the people are aged 40+, and fuck all activities for younger people. So IRL socializing is realy rare. Instead I've 
                    been trying dating apps, and that just feels realy disconected. It lacks a sortof humanity too it. You don't see the non verbals, you cant hear tone of 
                    voice. You are kinda forced to judge people by their cover. Half the people don't even bother to write a proper bio. The hastage interest systems are dog shit, 
                    with most people having basic shit like "I like music", like yeah nigga, who doesn't? But It's not all bad I like the weirdos, for some reason they make 
                    me feel at home. But again I feel like it never goes anyware. You try to meet up with some one and most of the time when I ask they are like yeah sure, 
                    but then keep making up excuses and pushing it back. I don't mean to sound paranoid but after like the 8th time I'm realy starting to question what the 
                    fuck is happening. Like is something wrong with me or is this how people try to say I'm not interested in a way where they try not to hurt your feelings? 
                    Honestly a simple fuck off would get the message across more clearly. I try to tell myself that they realy don't have time and would like to go out and reschedule, 
                    but getting stuck in this loop every time of "Oh sorry next time" and "Oh ok" is starting to wear me down. As I said I want to believe and I try to, 
                    just there's a limit and I'm starting to feel like an idiot for trusting people. There's a couple of girls that I've been trying to plan dates with 
                    and I realy hope that that doesn't happen again. <br><br>
                    But hey, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Am I right?
