                        First actual blog post on here. The fuck do people usualy blog about. IDK never realy read any blogs. 
                        I guess I'm just gonna write about the shit that's on my mind here, doubt anyone's gonna read this shit anyway. So yeah, 
                        I'm writing this at work (the whole website) because there's nothing to do here. I've been here for 5 weeks and out of that
                        there was maybe like one week that anyone wanted anything from me. It's a slow job but I'm not complaining, more time to work 
                        on my personal projects and shit. The first week they literaly had noone to teach me how to do the job, so they told me to go play 
                        some games or something. Than the week after that the guy who was supposed to show me around showed up, but we mainly just dicked around 
                        and chatted, so no work again. Thats when I started working on this page again. Sort of wanted to make a port folio of the stuff I work on. 
                        The next 2 weeks were a plant shutdown. Noone was here exept me and Ctibor (the instructor/mentor guy) and some other leftovers. 
                        We had 2 weeks to go through inventory and clear out anything that was not supposed to be there, we had it done the first week. 
                        Ctibor felt kinda sick so he said fuck it and took the next week of, I couldn't take time off yet so i went to work the whole week. 
                        So I pretty much go to work officialy as na expediant, but they pay me to write this web site &#9787;. Other than that I've been 
                        trying to get my shit together. I thing I've always been kinda whacked in the head, but after the breakup with Lucie I felt kinda 
                        like something in me was lost. I started going to a psychiatrist, thats been helping I guess. Everyone always ask like "Oh is it helping?, 
                        Are you feeling better?". Like yeah but no. I feel like I have to pay someone to listen to me insted of feeling comfortable just speaking to 
                        someone. The fuck do you thing I feel like. I feel better sure, getting this shit out of me instead of bottling it up is great, but I just feel 
                        that I would rather share shit with someone close. But than severe trust issues came in and said "Nah nigga u ain't doing that."
                        I've been trying to get over that, and I feel that I've made significant progress but it's always there. It never truly leaves. 
                        Also if anyone does read this and sees a buch of spelling mistakes, I couldn't be bothered to fix them, I'm running of like 3 
                        hours of sleep. I couldn't fall asleep last night and woke up at 3am for some reason. What else ... I still feel like I want 
                        to write something more but I'm not sure what. This that direct stream of conciousness type shit, gonna start writing the ehs... and uhs... 
                        I keep saying in my head. IDK like the two biggest thing on my mind right now is that I want to work on some projects, which is courently taken 
                        up by working on this website and trying to date again. The problem with that is that I feel like I push people away, and when I do I feel lonely. 
                        The eternal cycle of iritation and lonelyness. The worst thing is I dont thing I can be fixed, managed sure but not fixed. I courently live in a 
                        shithole of a town where most of the people are aged 40+, and fuck all activities for younger people. So IRL socializing is realy rare. Instead I've 
                        been trying dating apps, and that just feels realy disconected. It lacks a sortof humanity too it. You don't see the non verbals, you cant hear tone of 
                        voice. You are kinda forced to judge people by their cover. Half the people don't even bother to write a proper bio. The hastage interest systems are dog shit, 
                        with most people having basic shit like "I like music", like yeah nigga, who doesn't? But It's not all bad I like the weirdos, for some reason they make 
                        me feel at home. But again I feel like it never goes anyware. You try to meet up with some one and most of the time when I ask they are like yeah sure, 
                        but then keep making up excuses and pushing it back. I don't mean to sound paranoid but after like the 8th time I'm realy starting to question what the 
                        fuck is happening. Like is something wrong with me or is this how people try to say I'm not interested in a way where they try not to hurt your feelings? 
                        Honestly a simple fuck off would get the message across more clearly. I try to tell myself that they realy don't have time and would like to go out and reschedule, 
                        but getting stuck in this loop every time of "Oh sorry next time" and "Oh ok" is starting to wear me down. As I said I want to believe and I try to, 
                        just there's a limit and I'm starting to feel like an idiot for trusting people. There's a couple of girls that I've been trying to plan dates with 
                        and I realy hope that that doesn't happen again. But hey, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Am I right?<p>
