                        So we finished reccording Baldurs Gate yesterday. I have enougth footage for a years worth of editing. 
                        Atleast at the pace that I'm working now.<br><br>
                        I feel like I've been taking on way too many projects again for the past few weeks, and currently I've decided to work 
                        on a new video. Something other than BG3, I want to have more of a variety for the videos. And the Baldurs Gang shirt prints. 
                        The shirts shouldn't take that much time, like 4 shirts, one print a day should be ok.

                    <p>
                        Sup, I'm back again, not dead yet. <br><br>
                        Damn. It's been over a year since i last updated this site. I've read through 
                        all of my old blog posts and i find it funny how I've finished non of the things I've 
                        mentioned. <br><br>
                        But on the other hand I've done a bunch of other stuff. Started editing videos again. We're doing 
                        a Baldurs Gate 3 playthrough with the Bogler Gang. Made a couple of songs with Andy, we've even put them 
                        on spotify. First I wanna get the videos tab into a good looking state (hopefully wont take me another year) 
                        and then I should work on the music tab, there’s a bunch of stuff I can put there now.

                        Hey, haven't been here in a while. I just finished a music project i was working on and 
                        came here to update the links. Anyways looking through the pages here I just want a leave a 
                        note to myself, not everything need a text box next to it. I don’t even know what to put in 
                        all those textboxes. <br><br>
                        Also I'd like to add a movie review part to the site. Maybe somehow connect it to IMDB or 
                        something. It's just an idea that's been running through my head.

                    <p>
                        Ok, so I keep feeling less and less like I have something to say here. I just kinda wanna 
                        do stuff again. The current plan is to redo the website stylistically. Fuck learning a new 
                        skill at least for now. I really want to learn how to paint but I’ve got other shit on my 
                        mind right now.

                    <p>
                        OK, so I feel like I’m never gonna get the lightbox to work, so I’m just gonna write 
                        this disgusting spaghetti code of a mess and brute force the images on the different 
                        art pages, just so something is there until I figure this out. <br><br>
                        Otherwise I’m still a little sick and didn’t get any of the stuff I wanted to done. 
                        Managed to get all the basic shit done like the dishes and laundry, but that sapped 
                        all my energy for the day and I couldn’t get any creative juices flowing. <br><br>
                        I did though make a little art corner in my living room so hopefully I can get something 
                        done this week. I have an idea and everything, I just need to get my ass to work again.

                    <p>
                        So I’m sick as shit, didn’t work on anything yesterday and now have a full schedule 
                        of shit I have to do. YIPPEEEEEEEE!!! Thank fuck that this weekend is longer by Monday. <br><br>
                        Hopefully I’ll be healthy by than so I can work on something. I’d like to get this 
                        website to a presentable state. So I need to figure out the lightbox stuff and then 
                        figure out how to promote it. <br><br>
                        I also need to clean my place up, I don’t even remember when the last time I properly 
                        cleaned it was. I quickly went over everything about 2 weeks ago, but the last big shake up 
                        was some time before the flood.

                        So I’ve been sick for the last couple of days. Sore throat, sniffly, tired, 
                        all the standard bullshit.<br><br>
                        I really need to start working on something. Like an actual creative project, paint, draw, music or 
                        something. Working on this site is fun but it’s not something I can space out to. The rings are fun 
                        to make, but I only make those on demand. Yesterday while I was cleaning I put my easel in the living 
                        room, so hopefully I’ll start working on something. Might be fun to work on something while I’m sick 
                        and come up with some crazy delirious shit. <br><br>
                        Otherwise I still have no idea what direction I’m taking or even want to take in life but I guess 
                        shit’s been good lately. Maybe going a little crazy with the tattoos but eh, gotta do something fun.

                        I've been thinking of adding a store to this website. I’ve been making these wooden 
                        rings that glow in the dark and I’d like to try selling them to make an extra buck.<br><br>
                        But then again there’s literally no traffic on this site, so I don’t expect it to go 
                        anywhere. I’ve never really done any advertising for anything I do, but I’m gonna try 
                        throwing it up on Instagram and seeing how that goes.

                        So I decided to start this blog over. The last time it felt like just a bunch 
                        of angsty ramblings. This time I want to put at least a bit more effort into 
                        what actually goes here. <br><br>
                        This thing is publicly accessible so I don’t want to use this as a private diary 
                        anymore. I still don’t think anyone reads this, but some shit should stay private. 
                        Even though I want to get it off my chest somehow. <br><br>
                        I want to try turning this into a kind of study of my artistic process and all things 
                        related to that. My thoughts about projects that I’m working on, ideas, inspirations 
                        and all that. <br><br>
                        
                        I’m starting to get back into working on stuff. Small stuff so far but better than nothing. 
                        Finally got to work on nDies (Andrews music alias) profile pic and banner. Planning a little
                        Halloween stream on the Anarchy channel just to kind of keep it alive a bit. And I’ve been feeling 
                        like getting back into music, maybe even making and album or an EP.
