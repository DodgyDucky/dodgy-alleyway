                <p class="small_text">I go under Dodgy for most of my projects and I use the pseudonim Pilgrim for my music projects. I'm 22 and I've always loved 
                    to mess around with artsy shit and tech. I studied computers for 4 years and then decided that I could learn more from practice rather than school. 
                    I live in a shitty little town that doesn't have any IT jobs so I've just been doing whaterver jobs are availible to keep afloat while working on passion 
                    projects in my spare time. I want this website to be a repository/portfolio of my work and who I am. That's why I don't realy give a shit about swearing and shit. 
                    For anyone who finds this site and would like to contact me about anything hit me up over any of my social media things. I check that shit like once or twice a month, 
                    so it might take a while to respond. You'll mostly catch me on discord.<p>
